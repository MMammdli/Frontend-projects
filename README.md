## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Build frontend projects **from scratch**

## 🔐 Security Perspective

These are **frontend-only** projects and do not implement real backend authentication.

Security awareness demonstrated across projects:

- ❌ Avoiding unsafe functions (`eval`, inline JS)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- 🛡 Understanding risks like:
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - CSRF awareness
  - Client-side trust limitations

> ⚠️ Client-side validation alone is **never enough** in real applications.

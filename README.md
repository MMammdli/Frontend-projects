##  Goals of This Repository

- Practice frontend development from scratch
- Build strong JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills
- Apply **secure coding habits** even in frontend-only projects
- Maintain clean project structure and meaningful commits
- Create a solid GitHub portfolio

##  Security Perspective

These projects are **frontend-only** and do not implement real authentication or authorization.

Security principles highlighted across projects:
- Avoiding unsafe functions (e.g. `eval`)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Awareness of XSS, CSRF, and authentication risks
- Clear separation between frontend and backend responsibilities

>  Client-side validation alone is never sufficient for real-world applications.

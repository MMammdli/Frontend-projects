# Password Strength Checker

A simple frontend tool to evaluate how strong a password is in real time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## [Live Demo](https://mmammdli.github.io/Frontend-projects/password-strength-checker/)

##  About the Project

This project helps users check the strength of their passwords as they type. It visually shows whether a password is weak, medium, or strong based on criteria like length and character diversity. This is a great small project for practising DOM manipulation and basic frontend skills.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML** — Structure of the app  
- **CSS** — Styling and visual feedback  
- **JavaScript** — Logic for evaluating password strength

## Features

✔ Real-time strength feedback while typing  
✔ Color indicators to show strength level  
✔ Simple and responsive UI

##  How It Works

The strength logic checks for:

- Minimum length (e.g., 8+ characters)  
- Uppercase letters  
- Lowercase letters  
- Numbers  
- Special characters

As the user types, the script updates the UI to reflect how many criteria are met and changes the strength indicator accordingly.
